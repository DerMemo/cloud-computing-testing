Design Decisions

    Resource Structure:
        Resource Group: All Azure resources are organized into a single resource group to simplify management and billing.
        App Service Plan: The free tier (F1) was chosen to minimize costs, making it suitable for testing and development purposes.
        Web App: A basic Azure Web App is provisioned to host a Python-based application (PYTHON|3.8) for demonstration and deployment.
        Application Insights: (Optional) Added for monitoring and telemetry to track application performance and diagnose issues.

    Infrastructure Management with Pulumi:
        Pulumi was selected for managing infrastructure because it enables declarative and repeatable resource configurations using Python.
        Pulumi outputs are used to provide key details (e.g., Web App URL) for seamless integration with other workflows or automation.

    Testing Strategy:
        Unit Tests: Validate individual resource configurations, such as the App Service Plan tier.
        Integration Tests: Verify relationships between resources, ensuring the Web App is correctly associated with the App Service Plan.
        End-to-End Tests: Confirm the full stack deploys successfully and that the Web App is accessible.

    Scalability Considerations:
        The design ensures resources can scale to higher tiers or larger capacities with minimal changes to the infrastructure code.
        Monitoring with Application Insights supports proactive scaling decisions based on application usage and performance metrics.


    Scaling Beyond the Free Tier:

If the application traffic grows or requires higher compute/memory:

    App Service Plan:
        Upgrade to a paid tier, e.g., Basic Plan (B1):
            Estimated cost: ~$13.14/month (for 1 instance, 1.75 GB RAM, and 10 GB storage).

    Web App Traffic:
        Bandwidth usage: $0.087/GB (first 5 GB are free).

    Application Insights:
        Additional telemetry ingestion beyond the free 1 GB:
            Estimated cost: $2.30 per additional GB.

Example Scenario:

    Scaling for Medium Traffic:
        Basic App Service Plan (B1): $13.14/month.
        Application Insights: 3 GB data ingestion: $4.60/month.
        Bandwidth (10 GB beyond free): $0.87/month.
        Total Estimated Cost: ~$18.61/month.

    Scaling for High Traffic:
        Standard App Service Plan (S1): $73.00/month.
        Application Insights: 10 GB data ingestion: $20.70/month.
        Bandwidth (50 GB beyond free): $4.35/month.
        Total Estimated Cost: ~$98.05/month.
